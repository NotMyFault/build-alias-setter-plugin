    Normally, builds are identified by the number. User can attach any number of
    aliases that will serve the purpose of identifier in url (<tt>/job/&lt;job-name>/&lt;alias></tt>).

    <p>
    The update actually happens twice during the build; once right after the check
    out, and once before the build is completed. So depending on the way aliases
    are created, you might not see all the aliases until your build completes.
